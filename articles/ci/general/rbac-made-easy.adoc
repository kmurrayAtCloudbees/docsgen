== RBAC made easy

The Role-Based Access Control plugin gives a CloudBees administrator the ability to define various security roles that will apply to the system they administer.
Once roles have been defined, the CloudBees administrator can assign those roles to groups of users.
The assignment of roles can take place either at the global level, or limited to specific objects within the system.
Additionally, the CloudBees administrator can even delegate the management of groups for specific objects to specific users.
