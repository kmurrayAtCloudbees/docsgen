=== Plan an upgrade strategy for CloudBees CI

On average, CloudBees releases a new version of CloudBees CI every four to six weeks. In a perfect world, the {TEAM_NAME} team would upgrade CloudBees CI on a monthly basis after a proper validation process has occurred.

Always wait for a few days after a new release prior to applying the upgrade to any production system. Preferably, you would apply the upgrade in a non-prod environment to test prior to applying to a production environment.

NOTE: Since {CUSTOMER_ABBR} is using {K8S_PLATFORM}, it is feasible that you could spin up a new {K8S_PLATFORM} cluster with the current CloudBees CI version running in {CUSTOMER_ABBR}'s production environment and upgrade to the latest version. Once that validation is completed, that {K8S_PLATFORM} cluster can be destroyed.
