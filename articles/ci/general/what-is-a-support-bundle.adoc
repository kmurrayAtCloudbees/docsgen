== What is a support bundle?

The support bundle UI provides a list of all the classes of information that can be included in the support bundle.
Normally, it is best to include all the default information selected. It is possible to restrict information selected, however this may delay support in diagnosing issues.
Where possible, use the defaults.

For more information about a Support Bundle and how to create one can be found at

Finally, you can review the Arnaud Heritier's slides from his https://speakerdeck.com/aheritier/my-friend-the-support-bundle[My friend, the support bundle] session at DevOps World Nice 2018.
