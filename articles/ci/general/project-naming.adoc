== Limit project names to a sane (e.g. alphanumeric) character set

* Jenkins uses project names for folders related to the project. Many poorly written tools cannot handle spaces, dollar signs, or similar characters in file paths. So it's easiest to limit yourself to `e.g. [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` in project names, and use the _Display Name_ feature to make them look nice.
** You can define a pattern for allowed project names in _Configure Jenkins_ to enforce this restriction on all your users.
