== Hardware

For Operations Center and Client Controllers, you should acquire the following hardware with the following minimum requirements:

* 4 CPU
* 16GB RAM
* Minimum of 50GB of HDD. (Actual size will vary based on numerous variables)

NOTE: Every piece of CloudBees infrastructure should reside on it's own piece of hardware. Said differently, the *only* software running on an instance should be a single instance CloudBees software.

For agents:

* 2 CPU
* 8GB RAM
* Minimum of 50GB of HDD. (Actual size will vary based on numerous variables)

IMPORTANT: For performance reasons, all HDDs should be SSD. We have found that platter based drives rarely meet the performance expectations of clients.
