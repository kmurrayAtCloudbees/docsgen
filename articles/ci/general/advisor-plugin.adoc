== Health Advisor by CloudBees

The https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/plugins/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor[Health Advisor by CloudBees] plugin should be installed and configured for all of your CloudBees CI based products.

The plugin periodically sends support bundles to the CloudBees Advisor Service. These support bundles are scanned for potential issues. From these issues, recommendations are compiled into a report and
emailed to you.
