== Use a Shared Library

Instead of creating plugins or performing a lot of copy/paste to create jobs, you should use Shared Libraries to keep things simple and DRY.

Read the official https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[Shared Library] documentation for more details.

For a more advanced example, review the https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/10/02/pipeline-templates-with-shared-libraries/[Share a standard Pipeline across multiple projects with Shared Libraries] blog post.
