== Use Vendor supplied CLIs instead of plugins

Since all jobs should get to `sh`, `bat`, or `powershell` as quickly as possible, you should take advantage of vendor provided CLIs instead of CloudBees CI plugins.

For example, instead of using the Artifactory plugin to interact with Artifactory, you should instead use one of the following strategies in a `sh` step:

* use the https://jfrog.com/getcli/[JFrog CLI]
* use the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/[Apache Maven Deploy Plugin] if you are using Maven
* use the https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Gradle+Artifactory+Plugin[Gradle Artifactory Plugin] if you are using Gradle

All three of these recommendations use a CLI (`jfrog`, `mvn`, `gradle`) to interact with Artifactory. By using a CLI, you are able to validate that a process works *outside* of CloudBees CI, making it easier to troubleshoot and maintain.
