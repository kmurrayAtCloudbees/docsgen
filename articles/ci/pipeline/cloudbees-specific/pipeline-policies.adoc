== Pipeline Policies

Organizations often need to enforce standards across their pipelines. As the number of projects and repositories increase within an organization, there is a higher chance of teams deviating from these rules or best practices developed by the shared services team.

While administrators would like to enable their developers to use pipelines freely, they still may need to set some restrictions based on industry-specific regulatory compliance or general best practice principles.

Pipeline Policies are runtime validations that work for both scripted and declarative pipelines and provide administrators a way to include warnings for or block the execution of pipelines that do not comply with certain regulatory requirements rules or best practice guidelines.
