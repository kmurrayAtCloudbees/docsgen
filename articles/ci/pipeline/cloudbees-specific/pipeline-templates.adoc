== Pipeline Templates

Organizations operating at scale need consistency to prevent chaos. If each development team in your organization is creating their own Pipelines according to their own standards, thatâ€™s a recipe for disaster.

CloudBees Pipeline Templates give your organization the ability to enforce consistency. A small team can determine what Pipeline options are appropriate for your needs, and all of your development teams can choose from one of those options when they set up a software delivery project.

That way, your developers can focus on shipping product, and your organization can standardize the Pipelines they use to do it.
