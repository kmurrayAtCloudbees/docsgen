[NOTE]
====
One of the critical pre-requisites for your worker nodes:
`Use an instance type that allows premium disks (for example: Standard_D4s_v3)`

. It is recommended to use a CloudBees CI specific namespace in the cluster with permissions to create `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects. Typically this means having the `cluster-admin` super-user role in that namespace, and that namespace only.
+
NOTE: This is only needed during the installation. Services will run using the created roles with limited privileges.

. By default, CloudBees CI will use whatever class is configured to be the Default Storage class. Verify that a default storage class for each namespace has been set. To confirm you have a default storage class, run the following command:
+
[source,block]
----
kubectl get storageclass
----
In the output you should expect to see "default" next to one of the types, similar to below.
+
[source,block]
----
NAME            PROVISIONER
default         kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
gp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
----
+
NOTE: The `NAME` and `PROVISIONER` are likely to be different in your own environment.

. If `default` does not appear next to any `Name`, run the following command to set a default:
+
[source,block]
----
kubectl patch storageclass <your-class-name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
----
+
. Confirm that the storage class configured and intended for use by CloudBees CI dynamically creates persistent volumes.

NOTE: If CloudBees CI is being installed on-premise, https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/nfs-client[Kubernetes NFS-Client Provisioner] is the only supported provisioner.

. There are two ways you can provide an NFS-based Storage Class for CloudBees CI:

.. Create a new NFS-based Storage Class and make it the default. This is the easiest because you donâ€™t have to change the CloudBees CI configuration.

.. Create a new NFS-based Storage Class and then, before you deploy change the CloudBees CI configuration file to use the new storage class that you created.

+
[width="90%"]
|=========================================================
|Will the NFS storage class be default or not default? |
|=========================================================


. Make sure that your NFS storage is v4.1 and is backed by SSDs and *not* rotational drives.

+
[width="90%"]
|=========================================================
|Is NFS version 4.1 and SSD? |
|=========================================================


NOTE: https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/cloud-reference-architecture/ra-for-onprem/#_storage_requirements[Storage Requirements] has more detailed information about the specifics of using NFS on-premise.
